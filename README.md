# Film Showcase Website for NYU Tisch

This application was designed by Freja Smith for the NYU Tisch 2nd year film showcase, 2022. The purpose was to display film and bio info for a class of students, details about the show and links to book tickets.

View the live website at [2ndyearshowcase.com](https://www.2ndyearshowcase.com/).

The application was built using create-react-app. It uses JS to generate pop out bio components based on data from bio.js.
