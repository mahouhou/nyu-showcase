I am in my third year of receiving my masters for Directing at NYU, while also pursuing editing and producing. Collaborating with my peers on films has been one of the most fulfilling aspects of Grad Film that I look forward to continuing after graduation. In my film, Acquiescence, I want to represent the type of difficult situation that a young woman finds herself, that of resisting sexual advances, but finally submitting, or acquiescing to unwanted sex. And in most of these cases, a variety of emotions ensue, including taking responsibility for the assault itself, self loathing, and transformation of identity.",

The film was acquired by Freestyle Digital Media and is available widely on iTunes, Amazon, GooglePlay and other video-on-demand platforms. I am currently enrolled in an MBA/MFA dual degree program at New York University. The program accepts 5 applicants each year for the unique opportunity to pursue simultaneously both an MFA in film production at Tisch School of the Arts and an MBA from Leonard N. Stern School of Business. In addition, I am the recipient of the Story Mining and Supply Scholarship, offered for my strength in both programs. I will graduate from NYU in 2022. My personal story consists of vast experiences in media, filmmaking, and business strategy. I attended Barnard College at Columbia University where I received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Film Studies with a minor in Religion. I often think about how the dreams we have as children last us a lifetime. Cinema is a dream palace, a looking glass into our innermost humanity. As a producer, I am interested in stories that reflect communities who have never had that opportunity to see their experiences envisioned on screen. I want to tell stories for those who have never had role models, who have never had a chance to see their lives pictured, archived, observed, and healed. I want to tell their stories. I am currently producing a feature film “The Provenance” which explores the world of antiquities through the eyes of a young woman, tethered between the two cultures of her parents. I am also in development for the feature film, “Pacifica Diaries.” The film revolves around the lives and experiences of Asian-American students at Parker high school in the Silicon Valley.",
