        <p>The NYU Second Year Showcase is a celebration of the biggest event in our Graduate Film calendar;
            a screening of a yearâ€™s worth of work by 24 young writers and directors.
            Students travelled to 5 different countries and 7 different states to make these films,
            directing their own as well as crewing for one another.
            Come join us to watch these new stories take shape on the big screen!</p>
